INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of neuralintents to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    neuralintents 0.1.0 depends on tensorflow
    neuralintents 0.0.4 depends on tensorflow
    neuralintents 0.0.3 depends on tensorflow
    neuralintents 0.0.2 depends on tensorflow
    neuralintents 0.0.1 depends on tensorflow

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
